### What I learned

For this project, I used the property overflow, which I don't use very often. In this case, it specifies the desired behavior for the body's overflow.
The used value was hidden.

The code snippet is down below:
```css
body {
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
### Continued development

As noted previously, I will place emphasis on the property overflow and use other of its values.
